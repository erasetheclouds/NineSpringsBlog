# Overview

This page will be updated when herbicides will be used to fully describe the products, application method, and safety measures that are being taken to protect the applicator, the general public, and the surrounding environment. Preference will be taken for targeted and non-spray applications if full manual removal of a target species is not feasible.

## Baxter Park

## Indian Springs Park

# Oak Savanna

# Invasive Species

The invasive plant species listed below are slated for removal and maintenance will include reducing and maintaining the absence of these species to improve overall forest health. The large, woody species generally take priority, though second year (seeding) garlic mustard should also be targeted when applicable.

## Woody Species

### Buckthorn

*Rhamnus cathartica*
