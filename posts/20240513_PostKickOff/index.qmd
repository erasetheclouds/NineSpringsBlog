Flyers were successfully deliveredÂ to all households in the proposed area, but we were not able to get them out to Brighton, Kensington Pointe, or Hunt Club apartment complexes as door to door delivery was not possible and management was not able to be contacted to notify by email. We are deciding on if we would want to pay for a postcard delivery to each household, or if we are okay with trying to get a permanent flyer posted at the complexes or just at local businesses.

We had around 30 attendees with a good mix of long-term residents and newcomers.

The name of the association has been decided to be the [Badger Rock Neighborhood Association]{.underline}, though we will still have to coordinate with Badger Rock Middle School/Community Center to ensure that the name is not confusing to those groups. I had been attempting throughout this process to contact the community center as I was hoping they could help with contacts at the apartment complexes and that we could help publicize their events but I was unable to reach anyone.

[Regular meetings will be held quarterly in person on Fridays at 6pm, and as needed monthly virtually]{.underline}. The in person meetings will be held either at Badger Rock Community Center or Delta Beer Labs.

[The boundaries the city had previously provided us are accepted as they are]{.underline}, though we may reach out to Highland Manor in the future to see if they would like to be included, but we will let you know at that time if we wish to expand at that time. There is interest in also including those on the other side of Rimrock in the apartment complexes over there, but the general consensus as I understand it is that we're not going to turn anyone away who wants to be involved or attend events even if they are outside our official boundaries, which geographically make sense with Rimrock as the western boundary. We will design permanent flyers and post them at businesses on the west side of Rimrock.
