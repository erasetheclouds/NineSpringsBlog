I'm admittedly a little late on this update, but I still wanted to draw some attention to an Op-Ed written by one of our neighbors in the Badger Rock community.

Noah Lieberman has lived in the Badger Rock area since 2020 and was one of the candidates for the Madison Common Council last year against current Alderman Isadore Knox Jr.

Noah weighed in on the current discussion around housing in Madison in his guest column in the Capital Times back in June. You can read the full article here: [Capital Times Guest Column](https://captimes.com/opinion/guest-columns/opinion-fanlund-soglin-s-views-on-housing-betray-liberal-values/article_2b4e84c6-3263-11ef-81dd-176d1900bb3b.html)

Please contact the Badger Rock Neighborhood Association or attend one of our monthly meetings if you would like to similarly share writings from our neighbors in the future.
